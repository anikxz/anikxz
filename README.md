# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anik Dev Nath.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an enthusiastic developer with a keen interest in **Embedded Systems**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Circuit Design**.
I love creating innovative solutions that bridge hardware and software, making technology smarter and more efficient.

## ðŸŒ± Current Interests
- Embedded Systems: Designing and programming microcontrollers to create smart devices.
- Artificial Intelligence: Exploring machine learning algorithms and their applications in real-world problems.
- Circuit Design: Crafting efficient circuit layouts for various projects.

## ðŸ’» Skills
- **Programming Languages**: C, C++, Python, MATLAB and JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Arduino, Raspberry Pi
- **Circuit Design Software**: KiCad, Eagle, LTspice, Orcad,
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## ðŸ“š Notable Projects
- **Synthesis & Physical Design Analysis of a SIMD Processor**: Performed synthesis using Genus with required SDC constraints and generated netlist from Verilog code.
- **Mosquito Repellent System using Arduino**: The project being implemented is based on this very idea of using ultrasonic waves, which operate at a frequency that is incomprehensible to the human ears and other sensory systems.
- **A simple FDM system for DSB AM voice signal**: Multiplexing Frequency Division (FDM) is a multiplex technique that means more than 1 signal is combined across a common medium. For simultaneous transmission, FDM combines signals of different frequencies.
